Usage:
=====
You need Ivy to build this library (http://ant.apache.org/ivy/). After getting Ivy, you can build a JAR like this:

ant -lib /path/to/where/your/ivy/jar/is buildJar

After this you should be also able to import the directory you checked out from the SVN into Eclipse as a Dynamic Web Project and
run it on a servlet container. You will probably have to update the .classpath file (via Eclipse project settings, probably) as
it contains Mac OS X-specific settings now.
The project contains two test beans (see Spring app ctx and the "test" src folder).
